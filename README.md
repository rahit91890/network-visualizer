## Monetization Approach

Network Visualizer follows a dual monetization strategy:

### üìÑ Licensing Model
- **Free Tier**: Basic packet capture and visualization features
- **Pro License**: One-time purchase for advanced features (topology maps, exportable charts, offline mode)
- **Enterprise License**: Volume licensing for organizations with priority support

### üí≥ Subscription Services
- **Cloud Sync Subscription**: Monthly/annual plans for cloud storage and multi-device sync
- **Premium Alerts**: Advanced AI-powered anomaly detection and threat intelligence feeds
- **Plugin Marketplace**: Revenue sharing with plugin developers

## High-Level Tech Stack

### Frontend & Desktop Framework
- **Electron**: Cross-platform desktop application framework (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **React**: Modern component-based UI library
- **React Flow**: Interactive network topology visualization
- **Chart.js / D3.js**: Data visualization and charting
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling

### Backend & Processing
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for backend logic
- **Express**: Lightweight API server for plugin architecture
